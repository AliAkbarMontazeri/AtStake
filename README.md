@Stake
=======

@Stake is a game that fosters democracy, empathy, and creative problem solving for civic issues. Players take on a variety of roles and pitch ideas under a time pressure, competing to produce the best idea in the eyes of the table's “Decider.” 

This is a mobile (iOS & Android) version of the [tabletop game](http://engagementgamelab.org/games/@stake/) designed by the [Engagement Lab](http://elab.emerson.edu/) at Emerson College.

The game is being built in Unity3D 4.6. To setup the project, clone the repository and open the the project in Unity.

Players connect to an installation of Unity's Master Server at `54.149.47.87`. [Some edits were made](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/429957/unity-master-server-ubuntu-build-problem.html) to the Master Server.
