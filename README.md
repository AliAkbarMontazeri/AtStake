AtStake
=======

@Stake is a game that fosters democracy, empathy, and creative problem solving for civic issues. Players take on a variety of roles and pitch ideas under a time pressure, competing to produce the best idea in the eyes of the table's “Decider.” 

This is a mobile (iOS & Android) version of the (http://engagementgamelab.org/games/@stake/)[tabletop game] designed by the (http://elab.emerson.edu/)[Engagement Lab].

This is a Unity 4.6 Project.
